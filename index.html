				<h3 id="t1">Chicken</h3>
				<p>Green chimichurri, the classic Argentinian sauce often made with fresh herbs, garlic, red-pepper flakes and red-wine vinegar, livens up whatever it’s spooned over: steak, chicken, tofu, fish or vegetables. In this simple recipe, boneless chicken gets three layers of zesty chimichurri flavor: First, it’s marinated in the sauce. Then, it’s sautéed, grilled or roasted, which further intensifies the flavors and encourages caramelization. Finally, just before serving, it’s drizzled with fresh chimichurri for a bright finish.</p>
